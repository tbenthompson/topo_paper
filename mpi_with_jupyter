to use mpi4py.futures, I just needed to launch kernels with mpiexec
to do that, I needed to create a new kernelspec for jupyter
the kernelspecs are located in pythoninstalldir/share/jupyter/kernels/
and can be listed with "jupyter kernelspec list"
copy the python# directory to python#mpi
then edit the kernel.json file and add "mpiexec" in the argv list before "python"
