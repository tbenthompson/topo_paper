# Build GFs for the wenchuan model
# Push everything into the slides so I know what I need to finish up.
# Make edits to the vertical xsec fialko plot
# add some noise to the inversion input.
# Study the results of the subduction model
# presentation!

#TODO LATER:
# -- Do the inversion in one step.
# -- (maybe) do the inversion using the basis functions rather than the whole triangles.
# -- ?
# -- figure out the failure in the sphere model, run it! compare with an infinite free surface.
