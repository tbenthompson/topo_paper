# Do a little simulation-based proof of the idea that inverse errors are bounded by the condition number. Just correlate them.

# bssa 1993, landers, by hudnut, this should have data for the landers earthquake
# thoughts about wenchuan:
# -- there's no shallow slip deficit
# -- there's high resolution data on the footwall, but not the hanging wall
# -- there should be huge topographic effects
# -- the rake changes a lot along strike, particularly near the break in steep topography
#
# paper should have a double focus:
# 1) on topography
# 2) on general model errors and how they much more insidious and difficult than data errors

#   -- Erkki Somersalo seems to have cool info on inverse problems
#   -- I should read more about inverse problems in general though.
#   -- also the inverse error paper: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~elghaoui/Pubs/InvErr_LAA02
#       has some good thoughts on improvements over the condition number in terms of what influence it has on inversion errors and model uncertainty
#

#
#TODO LATER:
# -- figure out to properly scale the vectors and variables involved to nondimensionalize and get the iterative residual to be reasonable and maintain reasonable matrix conditioning ===> write out the linear system with the nondimensionalization included. this should actually done by the solver tools, not in tectosaur proper.
# add some noise to the inversion input.
# -- Do the inversion in one step.
# -- (maybe) do the inversion using the basis functions rather than the whole triangles.
# -- figure out the failure in the sphere model, run it! compare with an infinite free surface.
# mayavi in python3: https://github.com/enthought/mayavi/issues/84
# -- the green's function construction could go faster if i didn't reassemble the surface matrices for each green's function, then i would just need a bunch of solves.
