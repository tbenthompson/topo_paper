# set up the google slides and a basic outline

#TODO:
# -- set up the wenchuan model with real topo and fault geometry.

#TODO:
# -- check on the free_edge_constraints stuff for basin, seems a little sketchy in terms of dofs...
# -- this green's function construction could go faster if i didn't reassemble the surface matrices for each green's function, then i would just need a bunch of solves.

#TODO LATER:
# -- Do the inversion in one step.
# -- (maybe) do the inversion using the basis functions rather than the whole triangles.
# -- figure out to reference data dir in a finalized python installation
# -- CombinedMesh is handy even without multiple meshes, should i modify it or extend it so that it can be used more nicely for a single mesh situation (and has a better name!).
# -- should i create a nicer mesh data structure? consisting of the vertex and tri arrays with some other nice tools
